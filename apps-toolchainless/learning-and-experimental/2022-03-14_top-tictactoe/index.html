<p>
    This web app follows <a href="https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/full-stack-javascript/courses/javascript/lessons/tic-tac-toe">Project: Tic Tac Toe</a> from <a href="https://www.theodinproject.com/">The Odin Project</a>, including the AI extension criteria.
</p>
<p>
    This app wasn't designed with mobile in mind.
</p>
<p>
    Four different AI players are implemented:
    <ul>
        <li><b>Hard:</b> Plays perfectly by taking advantage of openings for guaranteed wins, or forcing a draw if there isn't one. Implemented using the Minimax algorithm.</li>
        <ul>
            <li><i>This AI may sometimes choose not to take a win on the next turn, but (I believe) it will only do so if it can guarantee a win in subsequent turns anyway.</i></li>
        </ul>
        <li><b>Medium:</b> During each turn, there's a 60% chance of playing like Hard mode, and a 40% chance of playing like Easy mode.</li>
        <li><b>Easy:</b> Picks any square at random. All empty squares have equal probabilities of being chosen.</li>
        <li><b>Loser:</b> Tries to lose. Similar to Hard mode, it will take advantage of openings for guaranteed losses, or forcing a draw if there isn't one. Also implemented using the Minimax algorithm.</li>
    </ul>
