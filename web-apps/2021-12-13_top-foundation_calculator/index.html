    This web app follows <a href="https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/foundations/courses/foundations/lessons/calculator">Project: Calculator</a> from <a href="https://www.theodinproject.com/">The Odin Project</a>, including all extension criteria (except making it look nice, but maybe I'll do that later!).
</p>
<p>
    All core features from assignment specification:
    <ul>
        <li>Operations are strung together, evaluating from left to right. E.g. <tt>12 + 7 - 5 * 3 =</tt> eventually evaluates to <tt>42</tt>.</li>
        <li>Numbers are rounded to fit on screen. User cannot input more than the screen size. Very large/small numbers are represented using scientific notation. The negative sign is also taken into account.</li>
        <li>Pressing the <tt>=</tt> button twice in a row does nothing.</li>
        <li><tt>NaN</tt> output (such as dividing by zero) puts the calculator into an error state that can be cleared using the <tt>AC</tt> button.</li>
        <li>The decimal point button can only be used once per number.</li>
        <li>
            Keybinds implemented:
            <tt>0-9</tt>,
            <tt>,</tt>,
            <tt>.</tt>,
            <tt>+</tt>,
            <tt>-</tt>,
            <tt>*</tt>,
            <tt>x</tt>,
            <tt>/</tt>,
            <tt>\</tt>,
            <tt>=</tt>,
            <tt>enter</tt>,
            <tt>escape</tt>,
            <tt>ctrl + z</tt>, and
            <tt>backspace</tt>.
        </li>
    </ul>
    Additional features:
    <ul>
        <li>Pressing <tt>-</tt> before a number is entered will make the number negative.</li>
        <li>Pressing +, &#215;, or &#247; before a number is entered will reuse the existing "current number". (This behaviour may be a bit confusing to use though since there's a delay in seeing the number.)</li>
        <li>Keyboard presses will also highlight the key pressed in the UI.</li>
    </ul>
    Issues with this implementation:
    <ul>
        <li>I'm relying on the Javascript <tt>Number</tt> implementation for numerical precision, which is represented using IEEE 754 double-precision floating point. This <i>may</i> have undesirable behaviour compared to BCD (binary-coded decimal), particularly around digits to the right of the decimal point. I haven't looked into how to mitigate these issues, and I don't know of any examples where these precision issues show up in this calculator. I'm not going to bother since this is meant to be a simple web development exercise.</li>
        <li>I didn't really try too hard to make this app render well on all platforms. This app was developed using Google Chrome on a minimally-customized Windows 10 system.</li>
        <li>The code is hard to read. I'll need to figure out how to untangle it.</li>
    </ul>
